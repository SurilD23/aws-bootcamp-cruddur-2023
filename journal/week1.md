# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

This week was really good. I had to pay extra close attention to how everything was fitting together, and there were a couple things I had to debug and get right specifically the env vars during the live stream and then when adding the endpoint in the backend and hooking it up to the front end. Here are some links to my commits:

#### Docker setup
- Backend and Frontend dockerfile linked up with docker-compose.yml:
